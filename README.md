IF else practise 

JavaScript Logic: Conditional Branching
This script demonstrates the use of if, else if, and else statements to control program flow based on variable values.

Key Features:
Binary Conditionals: Evaluates a single condition (age >= 18) to determine driving eligibility.

Multi-way Branching: Uses an else if chain to compare two numbers (a and b) and perform different arithmetic operations based on the result:

If a > b: Calculates the sum.

Else if a < b: Calculates the difference.

Else (if equal): Calculates the product.

State Management: Updates the value of variable x based on the conditional outcome and logs it to the console.
